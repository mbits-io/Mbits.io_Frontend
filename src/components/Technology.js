              <p>
                The 4th Industrial Revolution includes adopting smart
                technologies, cyber-physical systems, the Internet of Things,
                and the Internet of Systems. As a result, connected machines
                will interact and visualize the chains of production while
                making autonomous decisions. This revolution is anticipated to
                change every industry.{" "}

                The 4Ds represent a significant part with; digitalization,
                democratization, disintermediation, and decentralization. These
                are all processes that will play a key role, and whose effects
                we are already experiencing.

              <p>
                One of the new technologies that surfaced during this 4th
                Industrial Revolution is distributed ledger technology (DLT).
                Blockchain is a specific form of DLT and is also the most widely
                known due to the stellar rise of Bitcoin.
              </p>
              <p>
                Since blockchain technology plays a significant role in the 4th
                Industrial Revolution by placing the control of data back into
                the hands of individuals, it has the potential of bringing
                people closer to economic prosperity through applications such
                as Mbits.io. Our platform will empower people to possess
                ultimate control over their assets. The Mbits.io technology will
                be accessible, simple to learn, and readily available for the
                non-tech savvy user. To that end, Mbits will collaborate with a
                broad range of other major companies, investors, banks, research
                institutions, brands, and supply chain vendors.

                AI, or Artificial Intelligence is really an umbrella term on a

                Mbits.io aim to be a part of the development of AI, AGI and

                When true Artificial general intelligence (AGI) reach the

                will be 1000 times smarter the next day… Then it will take off
                from there. If we give this form of AI access to all the
                information in the world through the internet, the AI could make
                20,000 years of technological advancement in just one week. If
                we let it run for a month it could advance 500,000
                years...That’s 500,000 years ahead of us in only one month...
                and we will not be able to turn it off. After this it will
                exponentially speed up even more... two months can then be
                1,500,000 years... then its billions of times smarter than us

                Deep learning is a subset within Machine Learning. This
                technology attempts to mimic the neurons in brains using matrix
                mathematics.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is what we call a neural network. This was first discovered
                in 1957. The more complex networks are called Deep networks, but
                these was not practical before 2012. To feed both Artificial
                Intelligence, Machine learning and Deep learning, they need a
                vast amount of data. The explosion of the internet led to vast
                amount of data scattered around, but we need a smart way to
                utilize this raw data. Mbits.io aim to make use of the data and
                tie it together so it can be used in a manageable way by our

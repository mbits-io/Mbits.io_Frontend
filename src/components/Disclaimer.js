              <b>Acknowledgment of Advice</b>
              <p>
                The information provided on this website or on any of our
                affiliated websites does not constitute investment advice,
                financial advice, trading advice or any other sort of advice and
                you should not treat any of the website’s content as such.
                MBITS.io offers no advice on how you should buy, sell, or
                distribute tokens. Just as with any type of currency, MBITS.io
                does suggest that users conduct their own due diligence and
                consult your financial advisory before making any decision,
                whether it be exchange or purchase of currency.
              </p>
              <b>Availability and Accuracy of Information</b>
              <p>
                MBITS.io will strive to ensure the accuracy of the information
                listed on this website. However, with a growing market fit for
                new regulations, it is difficult to keep up with all the legal
                issues concerning the blockchain market. We encourage users to
                conduct their own legal research and to base your decisions off
                what you find. MBITS.io will tirelessly keep up with the legal
                issues as well, but will not be held responsible for information
                unavailable or inaccurate to users on this website or on any of
                our affiliated websites.
              </p>
              <b>Price Risk</b>
              <p>
                The prices can be highly volatile. It is common for prices to
                increase or decrease by over 100% in a single day. Although this
                could mean huge potential profits, this also could mean huge
                potential losses. Anyone looking to purchase, or exchange Tokens
                should consult a fully qualified independent professional
                financial adviser.
              </p>
              <b>Risks of Regulation</b>
              <p>
                No regulatory authority has examined or approved of the
                information in this website as of yet. No action has been or
                will be taken under the laws, regulatory requirements or rules
                of any jurisdiction, and the publication, distribution or
                dissemination of this website to you does not imply that the
                applicable laws, regulatory requirements or rules have been
                complied with. Although an exciting market with tremendous
                upside, the Token market has not yet been regulated to the
                extent, this will likely be down the line. The MBITS.io legal
                team is working rigorously to keep up with new case law and/or
                statutory guidelines (whether federal or at a state level) that
                implicate the services and products that Mbits.io offers.{" "}
